# Neighbor-Network
The problem we are trying to solve is to help students at Morgan State University gain access to materials that they need. This problem currently impacts society because college students generally don’t have a lot of money for food, personal items, etc. given that they pay for room and board, books, and tuition. The basis of this project is to provide a platform where students are able to trade for items that they need within their dormitories. Often times, students need supplies and don’t have access to transportation or don't have enough money to buy what they need. The goal of the Neighbor Network is to help students save time and money by giving them access to the resources that they need while allowing students to save money and network in the process.
